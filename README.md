Welcome to WATCHSHAPES.  This is a simple python script to compare the
Expected light collection efficiencies of different detector configurations.

Currently supported are cylindrical and spherical detector geometries.

Usage:  python main.py

Configurable options are found at the top of the main.py script.

lib.Plots.py contains several plotting functions that can be used to
visualize the results saved from main.py's output.
